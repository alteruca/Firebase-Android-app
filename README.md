# FirebaseGeoTrama

Android app in which different geolocations will be compared in order to find matches in time and space and visualize them with OpenstreetMaps

# Details
Firebase is used for the authentication and storage with JSON objects. Once the login has been passed, inside the application the location of the device will be eventually stored so it can be rescued in the future to compare it with another JSON.The idea is to check if at any momment these two persons were exactly in the same position given an accuracy of 5m and a timestamp difference of 10 minutes.
